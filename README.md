### Introduction to Terraform
Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp. It allows users to define and provision cloud and on-premises infrastructure using a declarative configuration language called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).
Why Terraform?
- Multi-cloud support: Works with AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and many other providers.
- Declarative approach: You describe the desired state, and Terraform ensures it happens.
- State management: Keeps track of infrastructure changes to maintain consistency.
- Automation & scalability: Helps DevOps teams automate infrastructure provisioning.
  
### How Terraform Works:

- Write: Define infrastructure in configuration files.
- Plan: Terraform generates an execution plan showing what will change.
- Apply: Terraform provisions or updates resources based on the plan.
