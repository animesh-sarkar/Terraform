**Terraform Providers**

Terraform providers are plugins that allow Terraform to interact with various cloud platforms, SaaS providers, and APIs. They enable Terraform to manage infrastructure resources across different environments. Each provider adds a set of resource types and data sources that Terraform can use.

In Terraform, the Azure provider block is used to configure the Microsoft Azure provider (azurerm) so that Terraform can manage Azure resources.
